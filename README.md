# Hey, I'm Jace

I build things, solve unique problems, and automate things in Python. I love working with API's and find reverse engineering them interesting and fun. Some of the projects that highlight that are: 

- [GHIN](https://github.com/jaceiverson/ghin_golf)
- [PL Discord Bot - Powered by FotMob](https://github.com/jaceiverson/pl-discord-bot)
- [Background Auto-Updater](https://github.com/jaceiverson/background-auto-updater)
  - Update your computer background to match an "image of the day" or webcam images.  
- [MTG Card Cost Tracker](https://github.com/jaceiverson/mtg_cost_tracker)
- [GeoGuessr](https://github.com/jaceiverson/geoguessr)
